React-Redux with JavaScript app
A simple React component which allows you to input new text messages. These are added to an array that's displayed in the view. 

Next, you'll create a Redux store and actions that manage the state of the messages array. 

Finally, you'll use react-reduxto connect the Redux store with your component, thereby extracting the local state into the Redux store.
